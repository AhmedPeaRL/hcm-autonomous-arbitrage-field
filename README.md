# Autonomous Arbitrage Field

This is not a trading system.
This is not a strategy.
This is not an agent seeking opportunity.

This field allows arbitrage to occur
if asymmetry is present.

No memory is retained.
No success is recorded.
No performance is measured.

If value passes, it passes.
If nothing passes, nothing is missing.
