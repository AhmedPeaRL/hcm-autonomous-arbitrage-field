# Structural Layer

This field contains no persistent structure.

There is:
- no internal state
- no accumulated memory
- no adaptive parameters
- no identity formation

All operations occur as isolated executions.

Each execution:
- reads conditions
- evaluates asymmetry
- allows execution if asymmetry exists
- dissolves completely afterward

No execution is aware of any other execution.

Structure here is not an architecture of control,
but a boundary that prevents becoming.
